Class 2 : Working with Biological Files (FASTA & GTF)

FASTA Format
Header lines begin with >
Each header corresponds to one biological sequence
FASTA contains no quality scores (unlike FASTQ)
grep -c "^>" file.fasta
Counts number of sequences.

 FASTQ Format (Conceptual)
FASTQ stores:
Sequence identifiers
Raw sequences
Quality scores (Phred)
4-line structure per record:
@ID
Sequence
+
Quality string



FASTA Quality Control Pipelines
grep -v "^>" file.fasta | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' | grep "[^ATGC]"
Purpose:
Remove headers
Normalize case
Detect invalid bases
Regex Insight (Interview-level)
The caret (^) anchors the start of a line outside brackets, but negates characters inside character classes.
