-- Pipes (`|`): Connecting Commands
A pipe sends stdout of one command directly into stdin of another.
Example:
* Counting files in a directory
This enables construction of efficient, memory-conscious pipelines.
---
grep (Global Regular Expression Print) is a powerful command-line utility in Unix/Linux systems used to search text within files for specific patterns or strings. It scans files and outputs lines that match a regular expression. It is essential for searching logs, filtering command output, and code analysis.
grep -c "^>" tga1-protein.fasta - to check no. of reads
grep -v "^>" tb1-protein.fasta | grep --color "[^ATGC]"

Practical Bioinformatics Context
Bioinformatics tools often:
* Output large results to stdout
* Send warnings or quality metrics to stderr
- Example:
* Running quality control tools on FASTQ files

Separating outputs ensures:
* Clean biological data
* Reproducibility
* Easier debugging
