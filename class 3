Class 2 : Working with Biological Files (FASTA & GTF)

FASTA Format
Header lines begin with >
Each header corresponds to one biological sequence
FASTA contains no quality scores (unlike FASTQ)
grep -c "^>" file.fasta
Counts number of sequences.

 FASTQ Format (Conceptual)
FASTQ stores:
Sequence identifiers
Raw sequences
Quality scores (Phred)
4-line structure per record:
@ID
Sequence
+
Quality string

GTF Format
Tab-separated genomic annotation format
Each row = genomic feature
Column 9 stores attributes:
gene_id
transcript_id
Exact quoting is required when searching attributes.

Safe Inspection of Large Files
Never cat large genomic files.
Tool	Purpose
less	Scroll safely
head	Inspect headers
tail	Check file endings
sed -n	Controlled range viewing
sed -n '1,50p' file.gtf

FASTA Quality Control Pipelines
grep -v "^>" file.fasta | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' | grep "[^ATGC]"
Purpose:
Remove headers
Normalize case
Detect invalid bases
Regex Insight (Interview-level)
The caret (^) anchors the start of a line outside brackets, but negates characters inside character classes.

GTF Parsing with awk
awk -F'\t' '$3=="exon" {print $1 ":" $4 "-" $5 "\t" $9}' file.gtf
Used for:
Extracting exon coordinates
Structured annotation parsing
