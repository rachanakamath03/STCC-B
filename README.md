## Short-Term Course on Unix for Bioinformatics

1. Introduction
Modern bioinformatics relies heavily on Unix/Linux environments for processing, analyzing, and managing large-scale biological datasets. This course focuses on practical command-line proficiency, enabling reproducible, scalable, and debuggable workflows commonly used in genomics, transcriptomics, and computational biology.
All commands were practiced using macOS Terminal, which is Unix-based and functionally equivalent to Linux systems used in HPC clusters and servers.

Why Linux / Unix Is Essential in Bioinformatics
Nature of Bioinformatics Data
Biological data is:
Large (GB–TB scale)
Text-based (FASTA, FASTQ, GTF, BED, VCF)
Often processed remotely (HPC, cloud)
Characteristics of Bioinformatics Tools
Most tools:
Lack graphical user interfaces
Expect text input via standard streams
Produce text-based outputs
Are designed to be chained in pipelines
