Overview

Unix is a foundational and indispensable skill for bioinformaticians. Most bioinformatics tools, pipelines, high-performance computing (HPC) environments, and cloud-based platforms are Unix/Linux-based. This course focuses on building practical Unix command-line proficiency for biological data analysis and research workflows.
This repository documents the concepts, commands, and practical use-cases covered during the Short-Term Course on Unix, with hands-on emphasis.

## System Environment
