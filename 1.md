# Unix / Shell Basics 0The Unix shell allows direct interaction with the operating system using commands. It is foundational for handling bioinformatics data.

Directory and File Navigation Commands
pwd- Prints the current working directory
Helps you know where you are in the filesystem

ls- Lists files and folders in the current directory
Variants:
ls folder_name → lists contents of a specific folder

cd- Changes the current directory
Examples:
cd folder_name → move into a folder
cd .. → move one directory level up

 Creating Files and Directories
mkdir- Creates a new directory (folder)

touch- Creates an empty file
Example:
touch x.csv
touch data.tsv

Writing and Viewing File Content
echo- Writes text into a file
Overwrite existing content:
echo "text" > x.csv
Append without overwriting:
echo "text" >> x.csv
Important:
> overwrites
>> appends (safe for biological data)

cat- Displays file contents on the terminal
Example:
cat x.csv

File and Directory Management
cp- Copies files from one location to another
Example:
cp STCC_B/class.csv demo2/

mv- Moves or renames files and directories
Used for: Organizing project structure
Renaming incorrectly named files

rmdir
Deletes empty directories only
Does not work on files or non-empty folders

Shell Productivity Shortcuts
Tab - Completion
Press Tab to auto-complete commands or file names
Reduces typing errors

Command History
↑ (up arrow) recalls the previous command
Useful for repeating or modifying commands

clear
Clears the terminal screen
Does not delete data or affect files

Why Do These Commands Matter in Bioinformatics:
-Bioinformatics workflows rely on structured directories
-Large datasets require safe file handling
-Mistakes like overwriting files can corrupt results
-Command-line efficiency improves reproducibility and speed
-These commands form the minimum operational literacy expected of any bioinformatics trainee.
